abstract = "A new approach for scalable routing in infrastructure-less wireless mobile networks is presented, requiring minor changes in existing link-state routing protocols and aggregating routing information with different levels of granularity into a hierarchy. The obtained results show that this routing scheme has better performance and is more efficient, exchanging up to ten times less routing traffic than other routing solutions. The proposed solution is particularly useful in large-scale scenarios, being robust against mobility phenomena, allowing limited wireless devices such as sensors and mobile phones to be part of these networks.
