\chapter{Collaboration Infrastructure}\label{ch:infrastructure}
The Technical Board setup the following infrastructure to support the collaborative development of the Pilots.

\textbf{GitHub} is the leading code hosting platform supporting development teams in tasks such as version control and collaboration. The TB established the \textbf{polifonia-project} GitHub organisation\footnote{\url{http://github.com/polifonia-project}} as the collaboration space for the technical activities of the consortium. The GitHub organisation currently includes 30 registered GitHub user accounts belonging to contributing project members.
So far, the collaborative space was used to collect stories and scenarios, including managing the discussion and actions of activity streams emerged in the Maninpasta workshop. Repositories include: registry, and ecosystem, which hosts the home page of the Polifonia Ecosystem.

\textbf{Discord}

The Technical Board \textbf{mailing list} is open to all project members interested in following or contributing to technical activities. Developers are particularly invited to subscribe, join technical board meetings, and use the list for technical discussions.
