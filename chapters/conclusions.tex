\chapter{Conclusions}
In this deliverable we reported on the collaborative methodology and tools for the development of the Polifonia Pilots.
The organisation of the development activities follows the principle of well-established agile software development practices but also specialises them in relation to the needs of a research project consortium.
The methods and tools are already used by the consortium members in the several activities, as reported in the last sections of the deliverables.
Decisions taken so far are based on past experiences of technical board members in similar large scale research projects.
Although we are confident that an agile methodology and a loosely-coupled approach to product development (the ecosystem) has several benefits compared to a water-fall approach and a tight software integration (the framework concept), the TB is committed to reviewing both approaches periodically, and adapt the decisions to better meet the project goals as well as the experience of the developers.
